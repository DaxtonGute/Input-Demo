# Input-Demo
A demonstration of how to use &lt;input>
Pls look at commit 7f75ab5
This was comparable, if not harder than the dinosaur game to code (many hours :( ). Big yikes. I should be able to add comments. If I do, I will update this. If this isn't updated, I am probably making comments as you read and I am sorry. Ok I go to sleep now. Gn Dr. J! Oh and also, I tested fairly rigourously (for a few hours and idt there are any bugs but there are lots of possible error places: don't read if you don't find any (in that case pretend you never read the paranthesis))
##update
still not complete but general function comments have been added. I may consider adding more. But generally I think the code is readable now.
